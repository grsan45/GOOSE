# Grayson's Odd Operating System Endeavour
### a.k.a GOOSE

---

This project is a way for me to learn more about operating system development.
Loosely guided by the [OsDev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org) and [Bran's Kernel Guide](http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/title.htm).

Written in C & ASM. Don't expect high quality or overly efficient code. 
This project is just for learning and experimenting. Maybe I'll have a "full" user mode OS in a couple of months.

Needs an i686-elf cross-compiler present in the project directory to compile.
